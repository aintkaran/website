            <div class="para">
                Have you heard of the belif especially well established in Indian middle class families of <span>"When
                    confused, choose engineering"</span>? Well, let's just say Karan fell victim to that notion and it
                changed his life for the best.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                Karan, being born in a small town, had to move out to aquire basic schooling. From Delhi to Kerala,
                Bihar to Rajasthan, all this movement did one thing and that is make him more <span>aware of the
                    cultural differences</span> but more importantly the esscence of what binds us together. In the
                midst of all the cultural chaos and uncertainity, he found his companion in perfectly imperfect
                <span>music</span>.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                He didn't end up join engineering, instead took some time off and completed his <span>Diploma in the Art
                    of Photography</span>, tried his hands on businesses and trades, and is now pursuing <span>User
                    Experience Design</span>. His <span>passion to learn</span> drives him to take on random colourful
                adventures deep into <span>diverse subject matters</span>. His borderline neurodivergence also
                contributes to his devotion towards <span>quality craftsmanship</span>.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                He loves to take some time off <span>cycling</span> through his, now, suburban town taking in all that
                he missed growing away from home.
